# Pull Request Guidelines for seed-to-sale-api

## If an alembic migration is created, make sure both upgrade and downgrade are working
## Make sure every change to db_functions is documented
## Each activity needs to be documented fully. Add the documentation to the appropriate API file, and delete the old doc file.
